Python program that interacts with an SQL database containing information about a museum.

The program has 3 levels of access in terms of database manipulation with higher levels requiring proper credentials.

The database can either be viewed, manipulated through a given set of choices, freely manipulated, or some / all of these depending on the access level.

Some SQL queries were also displayed to show the ways in which the database can be manipulated.

This program was built through the process of drawing diagrams of the database, creating the database, then building the Python program around it.
