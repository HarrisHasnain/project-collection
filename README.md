# Harris's Project Collection
Some of the programming projects I have worked on throughout the years that I would like to display.

Some of these are very large projects, while others are relatively simplistic.

Each project starts with the name of the language(s) that it was created in, and contains a short README.md description of the program functionality, for ease of browsing.
